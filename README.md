# Forest Rails Liana [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ForestAdmin/forest-rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ForestAdmin/forest-rails)

The official Rails liana for Forest.  
Forest is a modern admin interface (see the [live demo](https://app.forestadmin.com/login?livedemo)) that works on all major web frameworks.
forest_liana is the gem that makes Forest admin work on any Rails application.

## Installation

Visit [Forest's website](http://www.forestadmin.com), enter your email and click "Get started".  
You will then follow a 4-step process (also available in this 1 min [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTrMnidWLoM)):

1. Choose your stack (Rails)
2. Install Forest Liana
  ```ruby
  ## Add to your application's Gemfile
  gem 'forest_liana'

  ## Bundle it
  bundle install

  ## Install it with the provided environment secret
  rails g forest_liana:install FOREST-ENV-SECRET
  ```
3. Get your app running, provide your application URL and check if you have successfully installed Forest Liana on your app.  
4. Choose your credentials, log into https://app.forestadmin.com and start customizing your admin interface! ðŸŽ‰

**NOTE: If youâ€™re stuck, canâ€™t get something working or need some help, feel free to contact the Forest team at support@forestadmin.com**

## How it works

Installing forest_liana into your app will automatically generate an admin REST API for your app.  
This API allows the Forest admin UI to communicate with your app and operate on your data.  
Note that data from your app will never reach Forest's servers. Only your UI configuration is saved.  
As this gem is open-source, you're free to extend the admin REST API for any operation specific to your app.  

## Integrations

One core concept of Forest is to bring all your data back into one single admin interface. Forest integrates with the 3rd party services / SaaS you already use and allow you to manage all your operations from one place.
