## Pull Request checklist:

- [ ] Write an explicit title for the Pull Request
- [ ] Write changes made in the CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Create automatic tests
- [ ] No automatic tests failures
- [ ] Test manually the implemented changes
- [ ] Review my own code (indentation, syntax, style, simplicity, readability)
- [ ] Wonder if you can improve the existing code
